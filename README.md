## React Chat  
This little application is my first experience with React and Node.js.  
It's a chat for 2 users. You get a link for a new chat room whenever you open the app and don't join any existing chat room. Anyone can use that link to join your chat room but only if the room has <= 2 active users at the moment.  


## How to run  
- Go to *node-backend* folder and run `npm start`  
- Go to *react-frontend* folder and run `npm start`  
- Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser and chat with yourself!
