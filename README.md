## React Chat  
This little application is my first experience with React and Node.js.  
It's a chat for 2 users. You get a link for a new chat room whenever you open the app and don't join any existing chat room. Anyone can use that link to join your chat room but only if the room has <= 2 active users at the moment.  


## How to run  
### Development
- Go to *node-backend* folder and run `npm start` to start the Node.js server  
- Go to *react-frontend* folder and run `npm start` to start the React development server  
- Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser and chat with yourself! 
- You can edit your react app in real time and it will change in browser

### Production
- Go to *react-frontend* folder and run `npm run build` to create an optimized React build  
- Go to *node-backend* folder and run `npm start` to start the Node.js server  
- The application will be available at `localhost:8000`. Optimized React build will be directly served from the Node.js server
